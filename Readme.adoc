== Introduction

This is also a very, very old project of mine which once back started as a python project, then turned into a java prroject and finally into this kotlin project which you find in this repository.

The idea was to avoid complexity of using databases and instead use descriptor files which reside alongside with the pictures in a directory structure.

This runs currently on a raspberry pi 4 with 8GB RAM with an attached ssd drive which holds the pictures.
